=======
Tanyatu (http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=tanyatu&link=m): This project's goal is to create a Qt based modular multimedia system, with functionality of the system completely configurable and separate from the user interface. 
Another goal is developing core infrastructure with as less assumption about it's usage as possible enabling usage of the Tanyatu::Core component across different domains.

Please note that this project is still in early stages of development. Currently the player and playlist are integrated upto a level along with the UI.
