=======
Tanyatu (http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=tanyatu&link=m): This project's goal is to create a Qt based modular multimedia system, with functionality of the system completely configurable and separate from the user interface. 
Another goal is developing core infrastructure with as less assumption about it's usage as possible enabling usage of the Tanyatu::Core component across different domains.
